# Ectopic pregnancy

{: .no_toc }

_Isaac Hanley - April 2022_

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-100" markdown="1">

Any pregnancy that implants outside the uterine endometrium is considered an ectopic pregnancy.  The majority will occur in the fallopian tube but other sites are; uterine cervix, uterine cornua, ovary, caesarean section scar.

### Symptoms

* lower abdominal pain
* PV bleeding

### Examination Findings

* Ruptured:
  * focal tenderness
  * peritonism
  * guarding
* Un-ruptured
  * can have a normal exam but will often have mild tenderness on the iliac fossa of the affected side

### Investigations

* BetaHCG
  * if above 1500 IU/L then a TV-USS should see an intrauterine gestational sac if there is one present
  * if there is an ectopic there will often be a pregnancy sac identified (location depends on ectopic site)
* FBC, Group + Hold (rhesus negative women may need anti-D), Crossmatch (if bleeding heavily)
* USS – transvaginal

### Initial Management

* stabilise the pt – DRSABCD
  * make sure IV access is large bore (18g at least)
* keep nil-by-mouth until discussed with the on-call gynaecology registrar

### Definitive management

1. Expectant management
2. Medical management with methotrexate (either IM or IV)
3. Surgical management by laparoscopic removal of ectopic
