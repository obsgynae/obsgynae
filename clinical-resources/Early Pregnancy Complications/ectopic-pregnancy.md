# Ectopic pregnancy

{: .no_toc }

_Isaac Hanley - April 2022_

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-100" markdown="1">

_Any pregnancy that implants outside the uterine endometrium is considered an ectopic pregnancy.  The majority will occur in the fallopian tube but other sites are; uterine cervix, uterine cornua, ovary, caesarean section scar._

### Symptoms

* lower abdominal pain
* PV bleeding

### Examination Findings

* Ruptured:
  * focal tenderness
  * peritonism
  * guarding
* Un-ruptured
  * can have a normal exam but will often have mild tenderness on the iliac fossa of the affected side

### Investigations

* BetaHCG
  * if above 1500 IU/L then a TV-USS should see an intrauterine gestational sac if there is one present
  * if there is an ectopic there will often be a pregnancy sac identified (location depends on ectopic site)
* FBC, Group + Hold (rhesus negative women may need anti-D), Crossmatch (if bleeding heavily)
* USS – transvaginal

### Initial Management

* stabilise the pt – DRSABCD
  * make sure IV access is large bore (18g at least)
* keep nil-by-mouth until discussed with the on-call gynaecology registrar

### Definitive management

1. Expectant management
2. Medical management with methotrexate (either IM or IV)
3. Surgical management by laparoscopic removal of ectopic

### Presentation

* Lower abdominal pain
* PV bleeding (any bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy requires consideration of miscarriage)

Patients with an ectopic can either be:

* ruptured - these patient often have signs of peritonism on examination and if the intraperitoneal blood loss is large volume then they can be haemodynamically unstable (high HR / low BP) and look diaphoretic, pale and have a decreased GCS
* unruptured - these patients are stable, often with minimal abdominal tenderness

#### Other Important History

* date of LMP for pregnancy dating (always ask how regular the woman’s cycle was – if her menstrual cycle was erratic prior to getting pregnant than the LMP pregnancy dating is less accurate)
* any previous ultrasound scans in this pregnancy
* Gs & Ps
* Ms & Es – previous miscarriages & ectopics and what was done about them (what management)

#### O+G history worth considering

* previous deliveries…has patient had any caesars?

### Risk Factors

* previous ectopic pregnancy
* PID / chlamydia
* maternal age
* smoking

### Investigations

Blood tests:

* betaHCG: this is an important baseline – TV USS cannot reliably identify an intrauterine pregnancy when levels are below 1500 IU/L
* FBC: to ensure that patient is not anaemic from blood loss
* Group & Hold: this is important for both transfusion/blood bank reasons and as women who are rhesus negative should be given 250units of Anti-D in the event of early pregnancy bleeding (I have attached a link to the current RANZCOG guideline on this below)
* Cross Match: required if there is significant bleeding

Pelvic USS:

* Scan should be trans-vaginal to reliably identify a pregnancy in utero and the beta-HCG must be at least 1500 IU/L to expect to see the gestational sac on the image…the likelihood of an ongoing intrauterine pregnancy if this is not seen are low (less than 2%)
* Sometimes no pregnancy is seen anywhere (i.e. no intrauterine sac, no adnexal mass, normal pelvis, no free fluid) - in these situations the patient has a "pregnancy of unknown location" and needs serial hCG and specialist review

### Management

#### Immediate resuscitation

* a large bore cannula is essential
* IV fluids running unimpeded (1-2L of crystalloid)
* If the patient is haemodynamically unstable –prepare patient for OT and arrange urgent gynaecological review
* Analgesia

#### Expectant

* rarely used but can be considered if hCG is low (only really considered in Australia if hCG is under 1000 iu/L - however RCOG suggest it can be used upto 1500 iu/L)

#### Medical (methotrexate)

* can be given either IV or IM (depending on the hCG)
* safe and effective - 80-90% success
* offered as first line for non-tubal ectopics (such as caesarean scar ectopic / cornual ectopic)
* if tubal ectopic - avoids the removal of a tube (if a woman has previously had a salpingectomy)

_**Both expectant and medical management of an ectopic require a motivated patient.   These options require careful tracking of hCG until it is undetectable - which can take months.  Patients need to agree to engage in this process as neither of these options are guaranteed to work.  It is theoretically possible that a patient may elect to trial "expectant" management then have to have "medical" management before finally needing a laparoscopy!_

#### Surgical (laparoscopy)

* this is the only reasonable option for a patient who has a ruptured ectopic
* Salpingectomy is the preferred treatment in a woman having her first ectopic or if ruptured

### Complications

#### Short term

* surgical complications - removal of fallopian tube - at surgery the tube is almost always removed if the woman has a normal appearing contralateral tube - this reduces need for repeat surgery and the affected tube is damaged badly from the ectopic resulting in increased frequency of ectopic in the tube if it is left
* haemorrhage
* infertility - if both tubes are removed at any stage, or if the contralateral tube is abnormal, then IVF is the only way to conceive in future

#### Long term

* recurrent ectopic pregnancy - women who have an ectopic should be told to see their GP early in future pregnancies for a hCG and a location USS to allow early medical treatment of future ectopic pregnancies - should they occur
