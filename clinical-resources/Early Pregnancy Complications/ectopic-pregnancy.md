# Ectopic pregnancy

_Isaac Hanley - April 2022_

Any pregnancy that implants outside the uterine endometrium is considered an ectopic pregnancy.  The majority will occur in the fallopian tube but other sites are; uterine cervix, uterine cornua, ovary, caesarean section scar.

### Symptoms

* lower abdominal pain
* PV bleeding

### Examination Findings

* Ruptured:
  * focal tenderness
  * peritonism
  * guarding
* Un-ruptured
  * can have a normal exam but will often have mild tenderness on the iliac fossa of the affected side

### Investigations

* BetaHCG
  * if above 1500 IU/L then a TV-USS should see an intrauterine gestational sac if there is one present 
  * if there is an ectopic there will often be a pregnancy sac identified (location depends on ectopic site)
* FBC, Group + Hold (rhesus negative women may need anti-D), Crossmatch (if bleeding heavily)
* USS – transvaginal

### Initial Management

* stabilise the pt – DRSABCD
* ask: is this patient suitable for outpatient management?

### Definitive management

1. Expectant management
2. Medical management with misoprostol
3. Surgical management by currettage of the uterus

\** if the patient has had 3 miscarriages in a row - they warrant further investigations for this and should be referred to a fertility specialist **
