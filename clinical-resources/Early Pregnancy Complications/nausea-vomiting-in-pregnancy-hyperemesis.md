The following definitions have been suggested by the Society for Obstetric Medicine of Australia & New Zealand (SOMANZ) to help differentiate between nausea and vomiting, which is quite common, and hyperemesis gravidarum, which is less common.

**Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy:**  
Nausea, vomiting and/or dry retching caused by pregnancy, with symptoms commencing in the first trimester, without an alternate diagnosis.

**Hyperemesis Gravidarum:**  
Nausea and/or vomiting caused by pregnancy leading to significant reduction of oral intake and weight loss of at least 5% compared with pre-pregnancy, with or without dehydration and/or electrolyte abnormalities.

#### Symptoms

SOMANZ have created a scoring system that can be found on the [guideline](https://www.somanz.org/content/uploads/2020/07/NVP-EXEC-SUMMARY-1.2.20.pdf "SOMANZ Nausea in Pregnancy") that consists of 3 key questions to assess severity:

* In the last 24 hours, for how long have you felt nauseated or sick to your stomach?
* In the last 24 hours, have you vomited or thrown up?
* In the last 24 hours, how many times have you had retching or dry heaves without throwing up?
