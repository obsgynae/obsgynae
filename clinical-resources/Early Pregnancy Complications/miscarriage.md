# Miscarriage

### Symptoms

* crampy, lower abdominal pain
* PV bleeding

### Examination Findings

* Tender but not peritonitic lower abdomen
* Cervix examination (is it open? are there products-of-conception in the cervical os?)

### Investigations

* BetaHCG
  * if above 1500 IU/L then a TV-USS should see an intrauterine gestational sac
* FBC, Group + Hold (rhesus negative women may need anti-D), Crossmatch (if bleeding heavily)
* USS – transvaginal

### Initial Management

* stabilise the pt – DRSABCD
* ask: is this patient suitable for outpatient management?

### Definitive management

1. Expectant management
2. Medical management with misoprostol
3. Surgical management by currettage of the uterus

## Miscarriage – P.R.I.C.M.P

### Presentation

* cramp-like, lower abdominal pain (rarely severe)
* PV bleeding (any bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy requires consideration of miscarriage)

#### Other Important History

* date of LMP for pregnancy dating (always ask how regular the woman’s cycle was – if her menstrual cycle was erratic prior to getting pregnant than the LMP pregnancy dating is less accurate)
* any previous ultrasound scans in this pregnancy
* Gs & Ps
* Ms & Es – previous miscarriages and what was done about them (what management)

#### O+G history worth considering

* previous deliveries…has patient had any caesars?
* previous terminations of pregnancy (pt will often not think of this as a miscarriage – but if they had a suction currette – which a significant number of terminations will have had – we want to know about it)

### Risk Factors

* maternal age
* smoking
* ETOH/substance use

#### Investigations

Blood tests:

* betaHCG: this is an important baseline – TV USS cannot reliably identify an intrauterine pregnancy when levels are below 1500 IU/L
* FBC: to ensure that patient is not anaemic from blood loss
* Group & Hold: this is important for both transfusion/blood bank reasons and as women who are rhesus negative should be given 250units of Anti-D in the event of a miscarriage (I have attached a link to the current RANZCOG guideline on this below)
* Cross Match: required if there is significant bleeding

Pelvic USS:

* there are strict diagnostic criteria that outline when a pregnancy may be viable, non-viable (missed miscarriage) or unable to tell (yet…)
* Scan should be trans-vaginal to reliably identify a pregnancy in utero and the beta-HCG must be at least 1500 IU/L to expect to see the gestational sac on the image…the likelihood of an ongoing intrauterine pregnancy if this is not seen are low (less than 2%)

Pregnancy USS will often detail the following:

* Fetal pole: this is the forming embryo
* Crown-Rump Length (CRL): This is the length of the fetus-to-be. Once the CRL is 7mm there should be an identifiable fetal heart beat.
* Mean Sac Diameter (MSD): this is the gestational sac size. Once the MSD is 25mm there should be evidence of a fetal pole in the sac.

### Management

Patients having a miscarriage can lose large volumes of blood quickly – like anyone else in the ED they require a thorough primary survey.

#### Immediate resuscitation

* a large bore cannula is essential (especially important in second trimester miscarriages and if molar pregnancy is suspected – see section on GTD
* IV fluids running unimpeded (1-2L of crystalloid)
* If the patient is haemodynamically unstable – consider…could this be an ectopic? (they can still have PV bleeding!)
* Analgesia

#### Speculum examination

It’s important to see the cervix, if there are products distending the cervix it will…

* increase blood loss
* decrease blood pressure (autonomic stimulation dropping BP)

> Women who are having a miscarriage will often present to their GP or to the Emergency Department. If they are haemodynamically stable then it is not always necessary that they be seen by the gynaecology registrar and they can be managed in the Early Pregnancy Service (or equivalent) of your hospital. Most times this service will discuss options with the women but its worth advising them generally of the options below and providing any information you can.

In Australia – if treatment is required most women are offered the choice from the three options below:

#### Expectant

* appropriate for haemodynamically stable patients
* best for reliable patient who has good social supports and reasonable ability to get to a hospital quickly if haemorrhage develops
* betaHCG monitoring with GP to ensure it is dropping
* can take weeks to fully resolve

#### Medical (misoprostol)

* appropriate for haemodynamically stable patients
* compliant patients who want to avoid surgery but also want to expedite the miscarriage process

#### Surgical (suction currettage )

* best for suspicion of infection in uterus (often patient will be admitted for IVABs then consideration of suction currette after 24-48h)
* suspicion of gestational trophoblastic disease (see below)

### Complications

#### Short term

* haemorrhage
* incomplete resolution of miscarriage
* retained products of conception post management
* infected products of conception – endometritis
* operative complications
  * e.g. uterine perforation at suction currettage, incomplete evacuation

#### Long term

* Asherman’s syndrome
* Mental health implications
  * distress
  * sadness from loss of pregnancy
  * Gestational Trophoblastic Disease

A final point:

> This is a very difficult time for women and often it is left to the most junior doctor in the department to manage these situations(especially if the woman is stable). Be sure to offer support services to the women and make sure you take the time to tell them that you’re sorry for their loss. Even women who have had many babies find this a traumatic time and your actions and behaviour will be remembered by the family for a long time. Numbers of miscarriage are hard to quantify but it likely affects 25% of pregnancies – i.e. it is normal!

## Some definitions

* Miscarriage: the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of completed gestation.
* Complete miscarriage: A miscarriage is complete when there is an empty uterus on USS and the beta HCG has returned to zero.
* Incomplete miscarriage: Symptoms of a miscarriage but with USS evidence of retained products in the uterus.
* Threatened miscarriage: PV bleeding with a closed cervical os.
* Inevitable miscarriage: PV bleeding with an open cervical os.
* Missed miscarriage: USS evidence of a non-viable fetus (see criteria above) without symptoms of a miscarriage (i.e. no bleeding).
* Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL): A positive betaHCG and an USS that does not show an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). Sometimes this will be because the betaHCG threshold hasn’t been met yet – i.e. 1500 IU/L on a TV ultrasound – but other times it is suspicious for ectopic.
